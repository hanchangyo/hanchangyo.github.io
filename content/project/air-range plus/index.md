In AIR-range Plus, both real objects and the light source driving devices use small mobile robots. This allows users to interact with mid-air images via real objects placed on a table. We implemented an application where users can generate background mid-air images along with mid-air image characters on a table, and we conducted an exhibition and examination of this application.
