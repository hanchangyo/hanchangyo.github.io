Mode-Division Multiplexed (MDM) optical communication is a cutting-edge technique that boosts the data-carrying capacity of optical fibers by utilizing multiple transverse modes within the fiber as distinct channels for data transmission. By encoding information onto different modes and transmitting them simultaneously, MDM enables the transfer of substantially more data through a single fiber, akin to having multiple lanes within a single optical highway, thus addressing the growing demand for bandwidth and data throughput in communication networks. We developed and tested various MDM techniques.
