Invisible screen-camera communication is promising in that it does not interfere with the video viewing experience. In the imperceptible color vibration method, which displays two colors of the same luminance alternately at high speed for each pixel, embedded information is decoded by taking the difference between two temporaly distant frames. We retrieve the hidden information on the screen with commercially available smartphone cameras.
