abstract: An optical fiber cable of a mobile fronthaul system based on a radio over
  fiber (RoF), which includes a control apparatus for monitoring an analog optical
  link according to an exemplary embodiment, may be monitored. The monitoring control
  apparatus may include an optical signal monitor to monitor an optical signal passing
  through an optical fiber cable, and a system controller to control the optical signal
  based on a result of the monitoring. The optical signal monitor may calculate an
  average optical power, carrier-to-noise ratio (CNR), and a size of a nonlinear component
  from an electrical signal, which has been acquired from the optical signal. Then,
  the optical signal monitor may control the calculated average optical power, CNR,
  and nonlinear component.
