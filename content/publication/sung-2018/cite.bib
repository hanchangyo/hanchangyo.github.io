 abstract = {Provided is an analog optical transmission system using a dispersion management technique. The analog optical transmission system may include a digital unit (DU) pool including a plurality of DUs to transmit an optical signal; a plurality of radio units (RUs) to receive the optical signal; and one or more dispersion management apparatus to remove a signal distortion component caused by an interaction between a chirp and chromatic dispersion by compensating for the chromatic dispersion before the plurality of RUs receives the optical signal that is transmitted from the DU pool.},
