abstract: Provided is an analog optical transmission system using a dispersion management
  technique. The analog optical transmission system may include a digital unit (DU)
  pool including a plurality of DUs to transmit an optical signal; a plurality of
  radio units (RUs) to receive the optical signal; and one or more dispersion management
  apparatus to remove a signal distortion component caused by an interaction between
  a chirp and chromatic dispersion by compensating for the chromatic dispersion before
  the plurality of RUs receives the optical signal that is transmitted from the DU
  pool.
