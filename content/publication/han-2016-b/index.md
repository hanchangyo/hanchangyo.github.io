abstract: Herein, we demonstrate clipping distortion suppression of directly modulated
  multi‐IF‐over‐fiber links using a simple shunt diode predistorter. The dynamic range
  of a directly modulated analog fiber optic link is limited by nonlinear distortions
  caused by laser‐diode clipping. We investigate the link performance in the context
  of carrier‐to‐noise and distortion ratio (CNDR) and error vector magnitude (EVM)
  requirements when supporting LTE‐A services. We also design an analog predistorter
  with a shunt‐diode structure, and demonstrate experimentally that the predistorter
  has the ability to suppress clipping‐induced third‐order intermodulation distortions
  of the link by at most 14 dB. It also improves the CNDR and EVM of the 4‐IF‐multiplexed
  LTE‐A carriers by 7 dB and 2.9%, respectively.
