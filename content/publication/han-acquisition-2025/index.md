abstract: The monitoring of indoor HVAC data is critical in smart buildings to optimize
  energy use and maintain thermal comfort. Conventional stationary sensor systems
  face challenges in capturing data from elevated or diverse spatial points, limiting
  their ability to provide comprehensive volumetric data. These systems also lack
  adaptability to dynamic environmental changes and require an impractically dense
  sensor network for high spatial resolution. This study introduces a mobile robot-based
  approach for acquiring volumetric air conditioning data, aiming to achieve coverage
  comparable to densely distributed stationary sensors while enhancing flexibility
  and reducing infrastructure costs. Equipped with a vertically extending linear actuator,
  the robot collects airflow and temperature data using a 3D wind sensor and a temperature
  sensor mounted on the actuator’s tip. To ensure accuracy, the robot’s path was carefully
  planned to minimize the effects of the sensor’s thermal response time, ensuring
  consistent and reliable measurements. Using the collected data, a detailed thermal-airflow
  map of a coworking space was generated. Results demonstrate that this dynamic sensing
  approach offers significant advantages over stationary systems, presenting a cost-effective
  and flexible alternative for indoor environmental monitoring.
