 abstract = {A Mode Division Multiplexed Passive Optical Network (MDM-PON) apparatus includes: a non-mode selective multiplexer which includes a first end where three or more single-mode optical fibers are spaced apart from each other by a predetermined distance, and a second end where cores of the three or more single-mode optical fibers are tapered such that a gap between the three or more single-mode optical fibers is narrower than the predetermined distance while the three or more single-mode optical fibers are spaced apart from each other by an equal distance; an optical line terminal (OLT) which is connected to the second end through a few-mode fiber, and transmits a downstream optical signal; and three or more optical network units (ONUs) which is connected to the first end through the three or more single-mode optical fibers, and transmits upstream optical signals.},
