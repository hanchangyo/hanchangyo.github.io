abstract: 'A Mode Division Multiplexed Passive Optical Network (MDM-PON) apparatus
  includes: a non-mode selective multiplexer which includes a first end where three
  or more single-mode optical fibers are spaced apart from each other by a predetermined
  distance, and a second end where cores of the three or more single-mode optical
  fibers are tapered such that a gap between the three or more single-mode optical
  fibers is narrower than the predetermined distance while the three or more single-mode
  optical fibers are spaced apart from each other by an equal distance; an optical
  line terminal (OLT) which is connected to the second end through a few-mode fiber,
  and transmits a downstream optical signal; and three or more optical network units
  (ONUs) which is connected to the first end through the three or more single-mode
  optical fibers, and transmits upstream optical signals.'
