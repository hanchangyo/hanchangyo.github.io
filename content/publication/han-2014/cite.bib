 abstract = {Radio-over-fiber technique utilized by multiple IF carrier transmission scheme is expected to be a cost-effective solution for next generation mobile fronthaul architecture. We have experimentally investigated and compared multi-IF carrier generation methods based on analog IQ modulation and digital IQ modulation by back-to-back EVM measurement using five 64-QAM-LTE carriers having 20 MHz bandwidth.},
