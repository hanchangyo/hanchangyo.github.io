abstract: Radio-over-fiber technique utilized by multiple IF carrier transmission
  scheme is expected to be a cost-effective solution for next generation mobile fronthaul
  architecture. We have experimentally investigated and compared multi-IF carrier
  generation methods based on analog IQ modulation and digital IQ modulation by back-to-back
  EVM measurement using five 64-QAM-LTE carriers having 20 MHz bandwidth.
