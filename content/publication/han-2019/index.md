abstract: 'This paper introduces BumpMarker: a 3D-printed tangible marker that can
  perform simultaneous tagging, position tracking, and weight measurement of objects
  on pressure sensor sheets. The markers baseplate features several pins (raised dots)
  whose locations encode embedded information. A matrix pressure sensor sheet captures
  the pressure map of a marker-attached object on a sheet. The embedded data and object
  weight can be retrieved by processing the pressure map. We propose our design to
  achieve robust detection of the pins. We also show that our system has the ability
  to monitor weight changes in tagged objects. Through a series of evaluations, we
  investigate the technical feasibility of BumpMarker.'
