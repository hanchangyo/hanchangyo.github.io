 abstract = {The time-interleaved architecture is indispensable for high-speed digital-to-analog converters (DACs) in coherent optical transmitters. After analyzing the impact of misalignment of time-interleaved channels, we measure receiver-sensitivity degradation by such misalignment using QPSK and 16-QAM signals.},
