abstract: The time-interleaved architecture is indispensable for high-speed digital-to-analog
  converters (DACs) in coherent optical transmitters. After analyzing the impact of
  misalignment of time-interleaved channels, we measure receiver-sensitivity degradation
  by such misalignment using QPSK and 16-QAM signals.
