abstract: We propose a novel wavelength-demultiplexing algorithm applicable to Nyquist
  WDM systems. The proposed scheme features the ability of perfect wavelength demultiplexing
  even under the frequency offset half as large as the symbol rate. Through simulations
  and experiments, effectiveness of our scheme is demonstrated in 16-QAM Nyquist WDM
  systems.
