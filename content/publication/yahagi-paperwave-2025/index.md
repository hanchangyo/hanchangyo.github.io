abstract: Listening to audio content, such as podcasts and audiobooks, is one way
  for people to engage with knowledge. Listening affords people more mobility than
  reading by seeing, thereby broadening their learning opportunities. This study explores
  the potential applications of large language models (LLMs) to adapt text documents
  to audio content and addresses the lack of listening-friendly materials for niche
  content, such as research papers. LLMs can generate scripts of audio content in
  various styles tailored to specific needs, such as full-content duration or speech
  types (monologue or dialogue). To explore this potential, we developed PaperWave
  as a prototype that transforms academic paper PDFs into conversational podcasts.
  Our two-month investigation, involving 11 participants (including the authors),
  employed an autobiographical design, a field study, and a design workshop. The findings
  highlight the importance of considering listener interaction with their environment
  when designing document-to-audio systems.
