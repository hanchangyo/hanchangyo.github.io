 abstract = {Screen-camera communication enables instantaneous retrieval of on-screen information. Imperceptible screen-camera communication, embedding data in videos unnoticeably, holds great promise as it does not interfere with the viewing experience. The imperceptible color vibration method achieves this by alternately displaying two colors with the same luminance for each pixel. However, decoding performance may deteriorate due to interframe differences in the original video content. To address this, we propose a novel decoding approach using a dual-camera smartphone to capture two images with different modulation values simultaneously. This method allows for computing color differences between temporally close images, reducing artifacts from temporal changes in the original content. Our experimental results demonstrate an improved decoding rate and decreased recognition time compared to the previous method.},
