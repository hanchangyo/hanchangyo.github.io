abstract: Screen-camera communication enables instantaneous retrieval of on-screen
  information. Imperceptible screen-camera communication, embedding data in videos
  unnoticeably, holds great promise as it does not interfere with the viewing experience.
  The imperceptible color vibration method achieves this by alternately displaying
  two colors with the same luminance for each pixel. However, decoding performance
  may deteriorate due to interframe differences in the original video content. To
  address this, we propose a novel decoding approach using a dual-camera smartphone
  to capture two images with different modulation values simultaneously. This method
  allows for computing color differences between temporally close images, reducing
  artifacts from temporal changes in the original content. Our experimental results
  demonstrate an improved decoding rate and decreased recognition time compared to
  the previous method.
