abstract: We present ForceStamps, fiducial markers for supporting rapid prototyping
  of physical control interfaces on pressure-sensitive touch surfaces. We investigate
  marker design options for supporting various physical controls, with focusing on
  creating dedicated footprints and maintaining the structural stability. ForceStamps
  can be persistently tracked on surfaces along with the force information and other
  attributes. Designers without knowledge of electronics can rapidly prototype physical
  controls by attaching mechanisms to ForceStamps, while manipulating the haptic feedback
  with buffer materials. The created control widgets can be spatially configured on
  the touch surface to make an interface layout. We showcase a variety of example
  controls created with ForceStamps. In addition, we report on our analysis of a two-day
  musical instrument design workshop to explore the affordances of ForceStamps for
  making novel instruments with diverse interaction designs.
