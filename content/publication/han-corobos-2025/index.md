abstract:
  Swarm User Interfaces allow dynamic arrangement of user environments through
  the use of multiple mobile robots, but their operational range is typically confined
  to a single plane due to constraints imposed by their two-wheel propulsion systems.
  We present corobos, a proof-of-concept design that enables these robots to cooperatively
  transition between table (horizontal) and wall (vertical) surfaces seamlessly, without
  human intervention. Each robot is equipped with a uniquely designed slope structure
  that facilitates smooth rotation when another robot pushes it toward a target surface.
  Notably, this design relies solely on passive mechanical elements, eliminating the
  need for additional active electrical components. We investigated the design parameters
  of this structure and evaluated its transition success rate through experiments.
  Furthermore, we demonstrate various application examples to showcase the potential
  of corobos in enhancing user environments.
