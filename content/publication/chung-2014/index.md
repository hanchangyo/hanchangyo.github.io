abstract: We report a design of RoF based mobile fronthaul link considering quality
  of optical link and LTE/LTE-A signal simultaneously. The requirement of CNR in analog
  link supporting LTE/LTE-A services is presented, and effects of analog link quality
  on LTE/LTE-A signal is investigated. The EVM measurement after transmission of LTE-A
  signal with various numbers of intermediate frequency over 20 km SMF link is also
  presented.
