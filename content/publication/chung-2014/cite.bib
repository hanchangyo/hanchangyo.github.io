 abstract = {We report a design of RoF based mobile fronthaul link considering quality of optical link and LTE/LTE-A signal simultaneously. The requirement of CNR in analog link supporting LTE/LTE-A services is presented, and effects of analog link quality on LTE/LTE-A signal is investigated. The EVM measurement after transmission of LTE-A signal with various numbers of intermediate frequency over 20 km SMF link is also presented.},
