abstract: We propose all-fiber mode multiplexer composed of two consecutive LP₁₁ mode
  selective couplers that allows for the multiplexing of LP₀₁ mode and two-fold degenerate
  LP₁₁ modes. We demonstrate WDM transmission of 32 wavelength channels with 100 GHz
  spacing, each carrying 3 modes of 120 Gb/s polarization division multiplexed quadrature
  phase shifted keying (PDM-QPSK) signal, over 560 km of few-mode fiber (FMF). Long
  distance transmission is achieved by 6×6 multiple-input multiple-output digital
  signal processing and modal differential group delay compensated link of FMF. The
  all-fiber mode multiplexer has considerable potential to be used in mode- and wavelength-division
  multiplexed transmission.
