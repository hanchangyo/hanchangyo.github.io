abstract: This paper discusses about device characterization for mmW transceiver design.
  Especially, the de-embedding error is evaluated with a 60 GHz 4-stage amplifier
  and measured data of transmission line. According to a comparison of characteristic
  impedances of transmission line which are derived by Thru-only and L-2L de-embedding
  methods, there are about 5.9% error at 60 GHz in Thru-only one and less than 1.7
  % error in L-2L one. The error is also evaluated with the 4-stage amplifier, and
  it results in 1.5 dB gain error and 2.6 GHz frequency shift.
