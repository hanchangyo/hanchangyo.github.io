abstract: We investigated analog optical transmission performance degradation caused
  by nonlinear distortion by varying several operating conditions including the number
  of IF carrier, IF channel spacing, modulation index and transmission distance for
  future-proof cost-effective next generation mobile fronthaul architectures based
  on intermediate frequency over fiber (IFoF) technique.
