abstract: We demonstrate linearity improvement of directly-modulated multi-IF-over-fibre
  links using a simple shunt diode predistorter. We experimentally confirm that the
  predistorter is capable of suppressing third order intermodulation distortions of
  the link through two-tone test and 4-IF carrier-multiplexed LTE-A signal transmission
