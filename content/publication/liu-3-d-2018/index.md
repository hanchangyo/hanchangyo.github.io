abstract: 'Â© 2018 by the authors. 3D printing has attracted a lot of attention in
  recent years. Over the past three decades, various 3D printing technologies have
  been developed including photopolymerization-based, materials extrusion-based, sheet
  lamination-based, binder jetting-based, power bed fusion-based and direct energy
  deposition-based processes. 3D printing offers unparalleled flexibility and simplicity
  in the fabrication of highly complex 3D objects. Tactile sensors that emulate human
  tactile perceptions are used to translate mechanical signals such as force, pressure,
  strain, shear, torsion, bend, vibration, etc. into electrical signals and play a
  crucial role toward the realization of wearable electronics and electronic skin.
  To date, many types of 3D printing technologies have been applied in the manufacturing
  of various types of tactile sensors including piezoresistive, capacitive and piezoelectric
  sensors. This review attempts to summarize the current state-of-the-art 3D printing
  technologies and their applications in tactile sensors for wearable electronics
  and electronic skin. The applications are categorized into five aspects: 3D-printed
  molds for microstructuring substrate, electrodes and sensing element; 3D-printed
  flexible sensor substrate and sensor body for tactile sensors; 3D-printed sensing
  element; 3D-printed flexible and stretchable electrodes for tactile sensors; and
  fully 3D-printed tactile sensors. Latest advances in the fabrication of tactile
  sensors by 3D printing are reviewed and the advantages and limitations of various
  3D printing technologies and printable materials are discussed. Finally, future
  development of 3D-printed tactile sensors is discussed.'
