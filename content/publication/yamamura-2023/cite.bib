 abstract = {A sensor includes: a sensor section including a conductive structure made up of a three-dimensionally continuous unit lattices, each including a plurality of columnar beams; and output connectors that output a resistance value of the sensor section, the resistance value changing at least when the conductive structure is compressed by an external force. A method for manufacturing a sensor includes forming the sensor section by stacking using a 3D printer. The sensor and method for manufacturing the sensor enable the adjustment of the repulsive force against compression to an input member and thus appropriately setting the change in resistance value against external force according to the device, in which the sensor is to be incorporated and the mode of use.},
