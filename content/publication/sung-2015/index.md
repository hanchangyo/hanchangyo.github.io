abstract: Â©2015 Optical Society of America. We demonstrate the improvement of the
  transmission performance based on tone-reservation technique in a multiple intermediatefrequency-over-fiber
  (IFoF) based mobile fronthaul. The tone-reservation technique can suppress nonlinear
  distortion by eliminating the high peak components of orthogonal frequency-division
  multiplexing (OFDM) signal. To prevent the regrowth of peak, we employ tone-reservation
  after multiplexing IF carriers. Furthermore, we use an out-of-band signal as the
  reserved tones to avoid any modification of a mobile signal. The impact of the number
  of IF carriers on peak-To-Average power ratio (PAPR) characteristics is presented
  via numerical simulation. For the multi-IFoF based mobile fronthaul, we experimentally
  investigate the transmission performance of 36-IF carriers of the long term evolution-Advanced
  (LTE-A) signals mapped with 64-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). It is clearly
  observed that the clipping-induced nonlinear distortion is dramatically suppressed
  by using tone-reservation. As a result, the transmission performance of 36-IF carriers
  of the LTE-A signal is improved by an error-vector-magnitude (EVM) of 4% (from 9.7%
  to 5.7%) after 20-km transmission.
