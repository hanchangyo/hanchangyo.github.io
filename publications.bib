	abstract = {©2015 Optical Society of America. We demonstrate the improvement of the transmission performance based on tone-reservation technique in a multiple intermediatefrequency-over-fiber (IFoF) based mobile fronthaul. The tone-reservation technique can suppress nonlinear distortion by eliminating the high peak components of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) signal. To prevent the regrowth of peak, we employ tone-reservation after multiplexing IF carriers. Furthermore, we use an out-of-band signal as the reserved tones to avoid any modification of a mobile signal. The impact of the number of IF carriers on peak-To-Average power ratio (PAPR) characteristics is presented via numerical simulation. For the multi-IFoF based mobile fronthaul, we experimentally investigate the transmission performance of 36-IF carriers of the long term evolution-Advanced (LTE-A) signals mapped with 64-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). It is clearly observed that the clipping-induced nonlinear distortion is dramatically suppressed by using tone-reservation. As a result, the transmission performance of 36-IF carriers of the LTE-A signal is improved by an error-vector-magnitude (EVM) of 4\% (from 9.7\% to 5.7\%) after 20-km transmission.},

The performance of multi-IFoF transmission scheme is affected by fiber dispersion-induced second-order distortion in 1.5 μm. Thus, we derive an appropriate frequency plan to avoid the distortion. By utilizing the frequency plan, we successfully transmit 24- 20-MHz long-term evolution advanced (LTE-A) signals over 60-km single-mode fiber (SMF) without any penalties from the distortion. We also show the transmission performance when transmitting larger number of IF carriers in the limited modulation bandwidth so the penalties from the distortion are inevitable. We confirm that 72- 20-MHz LTE-A carriers can be transmitted over 30-km SMF within only 1.5-GHz modulation bandwidth.},

The markers baseplate features several pins (raised dots) whose locations encode embedded information. A matrix pressure sensor sheet captures the pressure map of a marker-attached object on a sheet. The embedded data and object weight can be retrieved by processing the pressure map. We propose our design to achieve robust detection of the pins. We also show that our system has the ability to monitor weight changes in tagged objects. Through a series of evaluations, we investigate the technical feasibility of BumpMarker.},

	abstract = {© 2018 by the authors. 3D printing has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. Over the past three decades, various 3D printing technologies have been developed including photopolymerization-based, materials extrusion-based, sheet lamination-based, binder jetting-based, power bed fusion-based and direct energy deposition-based processes. 3D printing offers unparalleled flexibility and simplicity in the fabrication of highly complex 3D objects. Tactile sensors that emulate human tactile perceptions are used to translate mechanical signals such as force, pressure, strain, shear, torsion, bend, vibration, etc. into electrical signals and play a crucial role toward the realization of wearable electronics and electronic skin. To date, many types of 3D printing technologies have been applied in the manufacturing of various types of tactile sensors including piezoresistive, capacitive and piezoelectric sensors. This review attempts to summarize the current state-of-the-art 3D printing technologies and their applications in tactile sensors for wearable electronics and electronic skin. The applications are categorized into five aspects: 3D-printed molds for microstructuring substrate, electrodes and sensing element; 3D-printed flexible sensor substrate and sensor body for tactile sensors; 3D-printed sensing element; 3D-printed flexible and stretchable electrodes for tactile sensors; and fully 3D-printed tactile sensors. Latest advances in the fabrication of tactile sensors by 3D printing are reviewed and the advantages and limitations of various 3D printing technologies and printable materials are discussed. Finally, future development of 3D-printed tactile sensors is discussed.},

PneuModule consists of a main module and extension modules. The main module is tracked on the touch surface and forwards continuous inputs from attached multiple extension modules to the touch surface. Extension modules have distinct mechanisms for user input, which pneumatically actuates the inflatable pins at the bottom of the main module through internal air pipes. The main module accepts multi-dimensional inputs since each pin is individually inflated by the corresponding air chamber. Also, since the extension modules are swappable and identifiable owing to the marker design, users can quickly customize the interface layout. We contribute to design details of inflatable pins and diverse pneumatic input control design examples for PneuModule. We also showcase the feasibility of PneuModule through a series of evaluations and interactive prototypes.},

Designers without knowledge of electronics can rapidly prototype physical controls by attaching mechanisms to ForceStamps, while manipulating the haptic feedback with buffer materials. The created control widgets can be spatially configured on the touch surface to make an interface layout. We showcase a variety of example controls created with ForceStamps. In addition, we report on our analysis of a two-day musical instrument design workshop to explore the affordances of ForceStamps for making novel instruments with diverse interaction designs.},

	abstract = {Digital musical instruments are essential technologies in modern musical composition and performance. However, the interface of the synthesizer is not intuitive enough and require extra knowledge because of the parameters. To address this problem, we propose pseudo-intention learning: a novel data collection method for supervised learning in musical instrument development. Pseudo-intention learning collects a data set of the paired target tone and input performed by the user. We developed a conversion framework that reflects the composer's intention by combining standard convolutional neural network and pseudo-intention learning. As a proof of concept, we constructed an interface that can freely manipulate the sound source of a digital snare drum and demonstrated its effectiveness with a pilot study. We confirmed that the tone parameters generated by our system reflected the user's intention. We also discuss applying this method to richer musical expression.},

In this paper, we propose a design of 3D-printed resistive soft sensors that can detect deformation by creating internal lattice structures with flexible conductive materials. The magnitude of deformation can be detected by measuring the resistance between a pair of electrodes. By adjusting the parameters of the lattice structure, a soft sensor with high flexibility of shape design and adjustable local softness can be realized. In addition, by inserting non-conductive structures into the sensor structure, external wires can be consolidated in one place. We present a design and fabrication pipeline, and investigate the fundamental characteristics of several patterns of sensors. We also show several applications that demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method.},

Imperceptible screen-camera communication, embedding data in videos unnoticeably, holds great promise as it does not interfere with the viewing experience. The imperceptible color vibration method achieves this by alternately displaying two colors with the same luminance for each pixel. However, decoding performance may deteriorate due to interframe differences in the original video content. To address this, we propose a novel decoding approach using a dual-camera smartphone to capture two images with different modulation values simultaneously. This method allows for computing color differences between temporally close images, reducing artifacts from temporal changes in the original content. Our experimental results demonstrate an improved decoding rate and decreased recognition time compared to the previous method.},

We present corobos, a proof-of-concept design that enables these robots to cooperatively transition between table (horizontal) and wall (vertical) surfaces seamlessly, without human intervention. Each robot is equipped with a uniquely designed slope structure that facilitates smooth rotation when another robot pushes it toward a target surface. Notably, this design relies solely on passive mechanical elements, eliminating the need for additional active electrical components. We investigated the design parameters of this structure and evaluated its transition success rate through experiments. Furthermore, we demonstrate various application examples to showcase the potential of corobos in enhancing user environments.},

	abstract = {The monitoring of indoor HVAC data is critical in smart buildings to optimize energy use and maintain thermal comfort. Conventional stationary sensor systems face challenges in capturing data from elevated or diverse spatial points, limiting their ability to provide comprehensive volumetric data. These systems also lack adaptability to dynamic environmental changes and require an impractically dense sensor network for high spatial resolution. This study introduces a mobile robot-based approach for acquiring volumetric air conditioning data, aiming to achieve coverage comparable to densely distributed stationary sensors while enhancing flexibility and reducing infrastructure costs. Equipped with a vertically extending linear actuator, the robot collects airflow and temperature data using a 3D wind sensor and a temperature sensor mounted on the actuator’s tip. To ensure accuracy, the robot’s path was carefully planned to minimize the effects of the sensor’s thermal response time, ensuring consistent and reliable measurements. Using the collected data, a detailed thermal-airflow map of a coworking space was generated. Results demonstrate that this dynamic sensing approach offers significant advantages over stationary systems, presenting a cost-effective and flexible alternative for indoor environmental monitoring.},

	abstract = {Listening to audio content, such as podcasts and audiobooks, is one way for people to engage with knowledge. Listening affords people more mobility than reading by seeing, thereby broadening their learning opportunities. This study explores the potential applications of large language models (LLMs) to adapt text documents to audio content and addresses the lack of listening-friendly materials for niche content, such as research papers. LLMs can generate scripts of audio content in various styles tailored to specific needs, such as full-content duration or speech types (monologue or dialogue). To explore this potential, we developed PaperWave as a prototype that transforms academic paper PDFs into conversational podcasts. Our two-month investigation, involving 11 participants (including the authors), employed an autobiographical design, a field study, and a design workshop. The findings highlight the importance of considering listener interaction with their environment when designing document-to-audio systems.},
